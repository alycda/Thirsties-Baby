<h3>What to Expect Next:</h3>

<p>Thank you for your interest in opening a Thirsties Wholesale Account! We have received your initial application.</p>

<p>We will verify your Tax ID resale license. Please note, this is not the same as an EIN. If you have provided your EIN number rather than a state issued business number or resale Tax ID, we cannot proceed any further with your application. Please resubmit with the proper information
Next we will look to see that you have a personally hosted, fully-activated website or a brick and mortar location.
So long as these first steps check out, you will hear back from us via email within 2-3 days.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your interest!</p>
